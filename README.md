# custom-HA-components

These are two custom components i wrote for my Home Assistant installation.
They are used to communicate with a "Delta Solivia EU G3" solar inverter and a "Gavazzi WM40-96" three phase power meter.
The code is by no means refined, it is just the bare minimum to get the job done, and that's enough for what I need.
